Despite increased waste management efforts, litter remains a prevalent issue in public spaces. To address this problem, I proposed as my senior project **Bind Earth**.

Bind Earth started as an integrated system that combines image recognition technology with community engagement. An imnage classification model leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks will be employed to identify litter in uploaded images, pinpointing its location on a global map. A web application will enable users to submit reports, collaborate on litter cleanup efforts, and track progress on a worldwide scale. This project aims to foster a community-driven solution to reduce litter and promote environmental responsibility.

Note: The goal of this repository is to show the main features of the application. The source code will remain private.

Important to note that the program is not deployed anymore since I don't have the time to maintain it.
